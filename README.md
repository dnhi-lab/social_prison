# Psychopathy in male prisoners and social interactions
All code and data for our psychopathy in male prisoners study

Preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/f8myc/

All analyses were done in Matlab (one figure in R), but for people who don't use Matlab, we included the data in .csv form

To protect the participants' privacy, we made the following changes:
- Any data from the PCL-R questionnaire was changed to NaN apart from the categorisation (from 1 = very low to 5 = very high; see script) at the end. The analyses were run on the raw scores as specified in the preprint/paper
- The order of participants in PCLR_4_R.txt was randomised and doesn't match the order of participants in the main data file
- Anyone interested in the raw data can contact Christoph Korn at christoph.korn@med.uni-heidelberg.de
